## [Link to the tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

## Features (provided in the tutorial)

- [x] Lets you play tic-tac-toe.
- [x] Indicates when a player has won the game.
- [x] Stores a game’s history as a game progresses.
- [x] Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

## Stretch Goals (not provided in the tutorial)

- [x] Refactor the code such that each component lives in its own file in a directory called "components"; that index.js holds only the ReactDOM.render function with reference to app.js, as well as root in index.html; and app.js acts as the component hub and holder of state.
- [x] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- [x] Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- [x] Rewrite the Board component to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [x] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [x] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- [x] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw and highlight it.
